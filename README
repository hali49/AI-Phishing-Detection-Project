🐟 AI-Phishing-Detection-Project 🎣

Because nobody likes being reeled in by a phishing scam!

Welcome to the AI Phishing Detection Project – a powerful (and occasionally humorous) defense against those crafty phishers who would love to take a bite out of your security.
🤔 What’s This All About?

Every day, inboxes around the world are infiltrated by emails promising lost fortunes, free prizes, and mysterious packages just waiting to be delivered. But we’re smarter than that, right? Well, just to be sure, this project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to help computers tell the difference between a friendly email and a sneaky scam.
📋 Project Highlights

    Binary Classification: We’re teaching AI to sort emails into “phishing” or “benign” categories. It’s a tough job, but somebody’s gotta do it.
    Feature Engineering Galore: Leveraging cutting-edge NLP tools, we’re examining email text for:
        Common topics (LDA)
        Sentiment (VADER – to see if it’s too good to be true)
        Keywords that scream "PHISHY!"
        Special markers like all caps, links, HTML, and exclamation points!!! (Did that last one make you suspicious?)
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) & Random Forest Classifier (RFC): We’re pulling out the big guns with models that mean business.

🛠️ How It Works

    Data Collection: We gather phishing and non-phishing emails from public sources. Think of it as AI training camp!
    Preprocessing: We clean, tokenize, and remove the fluff (like https and font tags) so our model can focus on the juicy details.
    Feature Extraction: We analyze email topics, sentiment, word patterns, and more to create a data fingerprint for each email.
    Model Training: Using RFC and CNN, we teach our AI how to spot a phishing attempt from a mile away.
    Testing & Tuning: We fine-tune and test the models for accuracy and robustness – because one missed phishing email is one too many.

🐟 Why Should You Care?

Did you know? Nearly 30% of phishing emails get opened, and plenty more sneak past traditional filters. So, whether you’re a cyber enthusiast or just sick of deleting fake offers, this project gives you the power to fight back.
